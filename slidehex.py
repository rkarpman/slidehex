def configspace(configt,board,CS):
    """
    Add all neighbors of a sliding-puzzle configuration to the dictionary CS.
    
    Keyword arguments:
    configt -- tuple representing a configuration of the board
    board -- list representing a hex board by coordinates of centers of hexes
    CS -- a dictionary whose keys are all configurations of the board
          values are lists which start with two integer flags,
          and to which neighbors of the configuration confight are added.
    
    This function finds all neighbors of the configuration configt, and 
    which may be reached by sliding a single tile, and adds them to the 
    list corresponding to confight. 
    
    The first entry of the list
    indexed by the configt is set to 1 to indicate that neighbors of this
    configuration have been found and added to CS.
    
    A separate flag is set for all neighbors 
    of configt, to indicate that they are in the same connected component. 
    If no neighbors are found, this same flag is set of -1 for configt itself.
